/////@@@@@Management's responsibility for the financial statements@@@@@

Management’s responsibility for the financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements of each of the Funds in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

/////@@@@@Auditor’s responsibility@@@@@


Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements of each of the Funds based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from
material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in each of our audits is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
